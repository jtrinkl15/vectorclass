# vectorclass
A vector class with methods for basic vector operations.

Ver. 1.0
- Takes 3 coordinates - plan to move to arbitrary numbers of coordinates
- str method prints a vector in angle brackets

Methods include:
  - addition
  - scalar multiplication
  - dot product
  - cross product
  - unit vector output
  
 Plans:
  - More than three coordinates per vector
  - calculus operations using scientific computing libraries (need to actually learn those)
